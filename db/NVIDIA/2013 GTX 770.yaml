  notes: G-Sync on this GPU only works for _real_ "G-Sync Ultimate" displays and is not compatible with LG 27GN800 i tested on, which is "G-Sync Compatible"
- connector: HDMI

  supported: false
  notes: GTX 770 does not want to output 1440p signal to 1440p display via HDMI natively, only upscaled to 4k30 to be downscaled back to into a blurry, laggy mess. Creating custom resolution results in pink lines on top of the blurry mess
